# RetailXtra; An Inventory Management System

As a Data Analyst, I developed "RetailXtra: Inventory Management System" for a retail company. Using SQL, I created a database to organize and track inventory, supplier details, and stock levels. I also queried the database to provide insights and answer key questions, supporting data-driven decision-making and streamlining operations.

The primary objective of this project was to architect and deploy a comprehensive inventory management system that would not only streamline the tracking and organization of products but also optimize stock levels and improve supply chain efficiency. This system was designed to empower the conceptual retail enterprise with the tools needed to enhance operational efficiency, ensure accurate inventory records, and facilitate data-driven decision-making across the company.
